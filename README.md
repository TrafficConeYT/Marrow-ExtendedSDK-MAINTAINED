# Upgrading an existing installation of Marrow-ExtendedSDK-MAINTAINED

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> IF UPDATING, MAKE SURE TO DELETE Marrow-ExtendedSDK-Maintained-main COMPLETELY FROM YOUR ASSETS FOLDER BEFORE DOWNLOADING THE NEW CODE DROPDOWN

If you already downloaded the original one, you should be able to just download this folder and replace your old one with this repository's. 

# IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PR SOMETHING TO THIS REPO PLEASE FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES:
### Do not PR any FUNCTIONAL/NON DUMMY scripts that come from paid asset packs/utilities. Dummy scripts are fine. Functional and FREE open source/public scripts are fine.
### Do not PR any art that must be paid for or was paid for by someone. This includes assets ripped directly from Bonelab (PRs containing direct Bonelab assets will not be accepted). Only free assets or assets personally made and granted free open access by the creator are allowed. (This keeps things like the examples usable with no worry about copyright)
